Meow I'm a cat.

This repo contains Kicad files for an Odrive auxiliary interface board.

This board plugs in to your Odrive and gives you JST-XH connectors for the GPIO.

This is version 1.2 (see previous commits for older versions).
1.2 uses an ethernet cable and RS-485 for interface for communications.
1.2 also features an e-stop circuit which must be driven by a square wave.

See parts_list.txt for a parts list for the older V1.1. See the current schematic for part info on 1.2.

Order the older V1.1 PCB directly from OSHPark here:

This board was designed by Taylor Alexander for Twisted Fields LLC.
Big thanks to Daniel Theobald for funding the work.
